Cella
=====

Cella is a web-based application to help participants in the Brown University
[Housing Lottery](http://reslife.brown.edu/current_students/lottery/about.html)

It is a successor to _Domus_, a desktop application with similar goals, built by Miya Schneider, Sumner Warren, and me for [CS 32](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0320.html).
